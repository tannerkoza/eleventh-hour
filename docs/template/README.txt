The Auburn University LaTeX style files have been updated for the ETD format change starting in Fall 2009. The style files are:
  ausample.tex    A sample file which demonstrates how to use the other sytle files
  aums.sty        Style file for Master's thesis papers
  auphd.sty       Style file for Doctoral dissertation papers.
  auhonors.sty    Style file for honors school, but using the same format as the new ETD guidelines. 

  ausample.pdf    The completed sample thesis built from the source located in ausample.tex.
  au_README.txt   This text file.

The files are tested to run with pdftex to build the thesis. If there are problems with the files, please note the version number. 

To use these files, copy the ausample.tex file to thesis.tex and then start writing your thesis.  Alternatively, you can look at the required items in ausample.tex and modify your pre-existing thesis tex file.

May you excel in writing your papers!

Sincerely,
Christopher Wilson
